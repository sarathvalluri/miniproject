    <h1>Programming languages</h1><hr>
    <p>A programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task. This set of instructions is usually viewed as incomprehensible code structured following a definite programming language syntax.</p>

    <h2> C-programming</h2><hr>
    <p> C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.<a href="c.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
    <h2> C++ </h2><hr>
    <p>C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a generic programming language for building software. It's an object-oriented language. In other words, it emphasizes using data fields with unique attributes (a.k.a. objects) rather than logic or functions. A common example of an object is a user account on a website.<a href="c++.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
    <h2>Java</h2><hr>
    <p>Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.<a href="java.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
    <h2>Python</h2><hr>
    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.<a href="python.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
    <h2>Ruby</h2><hr>
    <p>Ruby is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language that programmers use in many subfields of computer science. Artturi Jalli is CEO and co-founder of Nodesk and founder of Codingem. Ruby is a popular general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language that focuses on simplicity and productivity.<a href="ruby.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
    <h2>Go</h2><hr>
    <p>What is the Go or Golang programming language? Go, also called Golang or Go language, is an Open Source programming language that Google developed. Software developers use Go in an array of operating systems and frameworks to develop web applications, cloud and networking services, and other types of software.<a href="go.html">if you want to learn</a></p>
